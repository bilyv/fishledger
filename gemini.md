# Project Technical Requirements

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React.js with TypeScript
- Backend: Hono framework (TypeScript) deployed on Cloudflare
- Database: PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase
- Package Manager: npm

## Code Quality Standards
1. Code Documentation
   - All major functions and components must include JSDoc comments
   - Complex logic should be explained with inline comments

2. Best Practices
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Follow TypeScript strict mode guidelines
   - Maintain organized folder structure
   - Use consistent code formatting
   - Write readable and self-documenting code

## Database Requirements
1. Schema Organization
   - Main schema file: `main.sql` containing all table definitions
   - Individual table files (e.g., `users.sql`, `products.sql`)
   - Optimize column types for storage efficiency
   - Use appropriate data constraints

2. Table Design Guidelines
   - Use smallest appropriate data types
   - Implement proper indexing
   - Follow naming conventions
   - Include foreign key relationships

## Development Workflow
1. Command Execution
   - Use semicolon (;) for command chaining
   - Example: `cd server; npm run dev`

## Additional Notes
- Regular code reviews required
- Performance monitoring setup
- Security best practices implementation
